A refreshing view to add to the canon of quotes on getting up early.

“I’m not going to talk a lot about getting up early or going to bed late or anything else related to the course of a typical day, because everyone’s different”

Mind you, strong positions weakly held:
 
“Personally I think it’s worth whatever effort is involved to go to bed early enough to wake up early enough to have a good solid 45 minutes or an hour for breakfast each morning, if you can pull it off.”

I emphatically agree with this. Since becoming a dad, spending quality time in the morning has become so much more important, and it's become so much easier to get up and take the time to have a proper breakfast.
