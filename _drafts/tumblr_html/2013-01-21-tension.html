<p>I&rsquo;ve been working with one of my customers on designing some enhancements to our software, and I&rsquo;ve been thinking a bit about describing the requirements of a software system at a high level. Broadly, I think our system needs to do three things well to be successful:</p>
<ol><li>Hold the right information.</li>
<li>Allow its users to put information into the system easily.</li>
<li>Allow its users to get useful information out of the system.</li>
</ol><p>It seems to me that most of our requirements fall into one of those three categories. But there is a tension between those three categories, not least because of the variables in these statements: [right], [users], [easily], [useful] will all vary within a single system as well as between systems.</p>
