title: That architecture is all the stuff I spent ten years ranting on this blog about,
  but y’all don’t listen, so I’m just going to have to build company after company
  that runs my own wacky operating system, and eventually you’ll catch on. It’s OK
  to put people first. You don’t have to be a psychopath or work people to death or
  create heaps of messy code or work in noisy open offices.
