<p><span>&ldquo;When you ship a product in a box on the back of the box are screen shots and marquee features. What does not come on the box are lists of all the features you thought of doing or different executions you considered. It is that simple.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>There are five takeaways about what it takes to be a successful product manager in this article by Steven Sinofsky, but this comment about shipping - and particularly the metaphor of the box that the product is shipping in - is the bit that leapt out at me the most. (It&rsquo;s not actually a metaphor for Sinofsky - he learned this when software was shipped on actual floppies in actual boxes - but it is for the rest of us, now.)</p>
<p>When there are hard shipping deadlines for actually manufacturing a product physically and distributing it and putting it on shelves, this imposes a valuable constraint that helps to force decisions. In a softer, more digital world, without those tangible constraints, it&rsquo;s easier to relax and keep adding things in (related: if you can&rsquo;t see the task list/backlog, then it&rsquo;s easy to keep adding things to the task list/backlog &hellip; a post for another time), and deferring the release date.</p>
<p>Sinofksy&rsquo;s point isn&rsquo;t about deferring the release date and the temptation to relax decisions about what&rsquo;s in and what&rsquo;s out of the product. It&rsquo;s actually that you have to release the product in order to actually find out whether it works for your customers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is almost always the case that what you were thinking before you had customers will change in some ways in the version that comes next. So ship. Learn. Gather data. Iterate&hellip;The real challenge comes when deciding what to do next time around (in three weeks, three months or more). The first thing you do is remember all those things you could not get done or had to decide sub-optimally. So you think you’ll go back and “polish” off the work. But remember, now you have customers and they are using the product. They might not see what wasn’t done. They might actually like what you ended up doing. Your temptation to tweak things to “finish” them might come across as better in an incremental sense, but will it be that much better for existing customers?</p>

<p>Thinking back to the product box as a useful metaphor, this reminds me of the <a href="http://www.gogamestorm.com/?p=576">Design The Box gamestorming game</a>, which is intended to help prioritise ideas by thinking about how and where they would be included on the packaging for the product (major feature on the front? small print on the back? not at all?). Constraints are useful tools.</p>
