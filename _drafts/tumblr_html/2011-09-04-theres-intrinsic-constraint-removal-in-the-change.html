<p>Constraint removal is a technique that can be used to encourage transformational creativity (e.g.Â <em>Jones, S., Lynch, P. &amp; Maiden, N., 2008. Use and influence of creative ideas and requirements for a work-integrated learning system</em>). Removing constraints expands the scope of the system, facilitating the invention of novel requirements that might otherwise be blocked by the boundaries of the domain.</p>
<p>When we attempt to re-imagine a desktop application as a mobile application, we are intrinsically removing a constraint &ndash; the constraint that the user must be bound to a single location whilst using the system. This suggests that the act of inventing requirements for a mobile version could actually lead to novel requirements for the desktop version as a secondary benefit.</p>
