<p>This actually means, “it wasn’t important enough.” It wasn’t a high priority, fun, distracting, profitable or urgent enough to make it to the top of the list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/04/i-didnt-have-time.html">Seth Godin&rsquo;s blog</a>.</p>
<p>Very similar to Scott Berkun’s writings in <a href="http://scottberkun.com/2010/the-cult-of-busy/">The Cult of Busy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The phrase “I don’t have time for” should never be said. We all get the same amount of time every day. If you can’t do something it’s not about the quantity of time. It’s really about how important the task is to you. I’m sure if you were having a heart attack, you’d magically find time to go to the hospital. That time would come from something else you’d planned to do, but now seems less important. This is how time works all the time. What people really mean when they say “I don’t have time” is this thing is not important enough to earn my time. It’s a polite way to tell people they’re not worth your time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prioritisation is something I&rsquo;m starting to think a lot about, and specifically the importance of context in prioritisation. Priorities are always relative, and one of the big challenges I see when trying to prioritise fixes, enhancements, or tasks is the absence of context.  </p>
