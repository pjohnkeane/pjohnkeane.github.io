<p>I think that one of the most important things that product managers can and should do is to really understand how their customers get their work done. I also believe that product managers should always be seeking to explore their problem space and try to create innovations that change and improve the way their customers work, in ways their customers have never considered. A great way to do this is to learn from adjacent or even unrelated domains. In creative thinking, this is learning from analogy, cross-pollinating from outside the problem space.</p>

<p>On my commute recently, I’ve started listening to podcasts. I’d never got into podcasts, but since becoming a father my reading time has been eroded and it turns out podcasts whilst commuting are a terrific proxy. I’ve been listening to a few product management podcasts - e.g. <a href="http://www.thisisproductmanagement.com/">This is Product Management</a> from Alpha UX, highly recommended - but the one I’m going to focus on is <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/working.html">Slate’s Working</a>.</p>

<p>Slate’s Working takes a simple premise - interviewing people in various jobs about they go about their work - and turns into something fascinating. On one level, it’s an excellent primer in how to interview customers to help them voice their business drivers and goals, but I’ve been really interested in how even the mundane aspects of work can be thought-provoking when you observe them in unfamiliar situations. This is a great show.</p>
