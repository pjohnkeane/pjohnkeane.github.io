<p>I&rsquo;m the lone researcher on my MSc project, and that brings with it a set of problems. One of the major challenges that I&rsquo;m facing is that, because I&rsquo;m also the workshop facilitator for each workshop, I have to be careful not to introduce any bias or artificial influence into the sessions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just completed the first workshop, which was the control workshop intended to provide a baseline indicating what happens if creativity techniques aren&rsquo;t used. However, I&rsquo;ve been deeply involved for a couple of months now on thinking about the project, about creativity, and about mobile, so I was aware that there was a big risk that the knowledge and experience I&rsquo;ve picked up would influence my participation in the session. So I had to be very careful and deliberate about acting an artificial role with an appropriately reduced perspective. Not easy, and possibly even more difficult not to go too far the other way as a result, and no longer provide the level of facilitation (general enthusiasm, prompting for ideas, etc.) that I would have done had this been a standalone workshop. Awkward.</p>
<p>I think I managed ok, but it&rsquo;s a clear threat to validity for the project in pure scientific terms and validity is obviously going to be an important part of my write-up. In mitigation of many of the validity issues, I&rsquo;m positioning the project as a case study of a practical approach, rather than a truly controlled, repeatable lab study, but it&rsquo;s still going to be important to record and analyse these issues.</p>
