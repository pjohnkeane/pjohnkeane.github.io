Four quotes from Marc Andreessen on product/market fit:

> "Product quality and market size are completely different."
 
That is, just because your product is totally awesome, doesn't mean you're going to be really successful. You need there to be enough people who are actually going to buy the product:

> "Market is the most important factor in a startup's success or failure."
 
The market is where the money is made. If there's no market, there's no product. And if there _is_ a market:

> "The market needs to be fulfilled and the market will be fulfilled, by the first viable product that comes along."

If there's a market need, then the market will make the product a success. And the product doesn't have to be awesome, it just needs to be viable. Though I doubt it's a problem if the product is awesome. That probably makes things easier. Regardless:
 
> "Do whatever is required to get to product/market fit."

Andreessen recommends aggressively pursuing product/market fit, making sure you're focussed externally on understanding what the market needs, what problems your customers have, and making sure that your product is a viable solution to those problems, packaged in a way that suits the market.
