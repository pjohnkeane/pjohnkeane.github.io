# Focus on customers and tasks, not features

[Gerry McGovern](http://www.gerrymcgovern.com/new-thinking) writes about customer-centric approaches to web content, specifically agitating for a relentless focus on the top tasks of a website's customers. I've had this snippet from [an article of his about Yahoo, a content company, hiring Marissa Mayer, a product person, as CEO](http://www.gerrymcgovern.com/new-thinking/content-enabler) sitting around since mid-2012, and [my recent post about features and product roadmaps](http://biscuitsforcheese.co.uk/post/126907408176/feature-requests-product-roadmaps-opportunity-backlog) inspired me to finally do something with it.

>I never advise clients to focus on the content. A content focus generally leads to dead ends and a whole raft of bad practice. Focus on the customer instead and what they want to do. 

>The difference in approach and thinking may seem subtle and academic but it is critical to success. Content thinking and technology thinking are classic organization-centric approaches. People don't want to get to the 'book a flight' tool. **They want to get to Dublin from London.** People don't want the installation manual. **They want to install the product.** For most people, content or technology is not the end, not the point.

For _content_, read _features_. Focus on customers and tasks, not features.
