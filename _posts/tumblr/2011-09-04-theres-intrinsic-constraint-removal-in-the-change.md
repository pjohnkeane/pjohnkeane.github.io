Constraint removal is a technique that can be used to encourage transformational creativity (e.g. Jones, S., Lynch, P. & Maiden, N., 2008. Use and influence of creative ideas and requirements for a work-integrated learning system). Removing constraints expands the scope of the system, facilitating the invention of novel requirements that might otherwise be blocked by the boundaries of the domain.
When we attempt to re-imagine a desktop application as a mobile application, we are intrinsically removing a constraint – the constraint that the user must be bound to a single location whilst using the system. This suggests that the act of inventing requirements for a mobile version could actually lead to novel requirements for the desktop version as a secondary benefit.
