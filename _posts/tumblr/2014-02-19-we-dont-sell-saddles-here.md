We Don’t Sell Saddles HereThis is a memo from Stewart Butterfield (ex-Flickr, now running a company called Tiny Speck) to his team working on Slack, their new product. And it’s terrific.

The memo is concerned with setting the vision and direction for a product that’s still months away from public release, and setting product-market fit by defining the market. It does this by describing a whole bunch of principles including selling the change in the customer, not the features of the product (sell horseback riding, not the saddles of the title), and how to get there, like passionate attention to quality by focusing relentlessly on the experience of the customer:


It is always harder to do this with one’s own product: we skip over the bad parts knowing that we plan to fix it later. We already know the model we’re using and the terms we use to describe it. It is very difficult to approach Slack with beginner’s mind. But we have to, all of us, and we have to do it every day, over and over and polish every rough edge off until this product is as smooth as lacquered mahogany.


Butterfield gets his points across with excellent examples and clear, enthusiastic language. Recommended reading.
