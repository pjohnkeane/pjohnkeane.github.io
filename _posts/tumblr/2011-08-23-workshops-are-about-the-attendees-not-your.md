title: Workshops are about the attendees, not your designs. Turn your attention outward.
  Make the participants feel valued and listened to. The attendees have given up their
  valuable time to be there – recognise and respect this. Be clear about what you
  need from them, plan well, get as much as you can out of the day and communicate
  it back.
