In-car hands-free

I’ve witnessed cabbies innovating before, though usually with things like lane discipline and social interaction with other drivers and so on, not so much with their tech (other than not wearing their seat belts).

This morning I noticed my driver’s clever hands-free mobile trick, strapping his phone to the sun visor so he could swing it round next to his ear as needed. Smart.
