I underestimated what was involved in facilitating a creativity workshop. Just finished my pilot workshop, and I was totally unprepared for how much preparation was required. Important to be sure about what you’re going to say to introduce and explain any games, especially when your participants might be naturally wary or sceptical of “creativity”.
Still, this is the point of a pilot.
