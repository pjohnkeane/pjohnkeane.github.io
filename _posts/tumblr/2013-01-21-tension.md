I’ve been working with one of my customers on designing some enhancements to our software, and I’ve been thinking a bit about describing the requirements of a software system at a high level. Broadly, I think our system needs to do three things well to be successful:
Hold the right information.
Allow its users to put information into the system easily.
Allow its users to get useful information out of the system.
It seems to me that most of our requirements fall into one of those three categories. But there is a tension between those three categories, not least because of the variables in these statements: [right], [users], [easily], [useful] will all vary within a single system as well as between systems.
