I was talking this week with some folks at a software company who are working on ideas around automating various financial services transactions from end-to-end, seeking to make it possible for the end user to perform the whole transaction without needing to interact with a real person (there are various benefits to this approach including efficiency, reduced cost, and the user's perception of control/ownership of the process). 

Now, it's not (yet) possible to replace every aspect of the business process with an automated solution, but this company are trying to make it appear like this has happened - to make it impossible to tell whether you're dealing with a person or a machine at each point. Their strategy is to make the copy they use in their interface informal and chatty, and this reminded me of another old article I had sitting around waiting to be blogged, which talks about how [software is a conversation](http://www.jacksonfish.com/blog/2012/03/21/software-is-a-conversation/):

> While depending on the brand of the software experience the voice of a piece of software can vary to a certain degree, the baseline to start with is that of someone friendly, but not overly familiar, and ultimately there to serve – an incredible server at your favorite restaurant perhaps? There when you need them, gone when you don’t. Not overly familiar, but definitely putting you at ease. Efficient in language — definitely not verbose. And ultimately focused on serving the user effectively without being overly familiar or chummy.

I think this is a great guideline to use. Overly familiar language can come across as tacky or gimmicky, though it's possible to carry it off with the right brand - [Mailchimp do it really well](http://voiceandtone.com/compliance-alert), for example - but that doesn't mean that software can't be personable, and certainly doesn't mean it has to talk like a machine.
