Recently, I took part in a short chat on the [Product Manager HQ](http://www.productmanagerhq.com) Slack group about idea management and best practice for logging feature requests. I was reminded about the [Forget Feature Requests](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch05_Forget_Feature_Requests.php) chapter in Getting Real by 37signals<label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">[Getting Real](http://gettingreal.37signals.com) and its follow-up [ReWork](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0091929784/) come very strongly recommended. These books made me realise that there were ways of working that aligned with what I believed, and that I didn't necessarily have to just follow the status quo.</span>:


>   “Don’t worry about tracking and saving each request that comes in. Let your customers be your memory. If it’s really worth remembering, they’ll remind you until you can’t forget.”


Marty Cagan has also campaigned [against maintaining lists of feature requests](http://www.svpg.com/product-roadmaps/):


>   “First and foremost, your job is not to prioritize and document feature requests. Your job is to deliver a product that is valuable, usable and feasible. The feature request spreadsheet works against this end by pushing through features that users don’t value or need, increasing complexity, decreasing usability, and wasting engineering cycles.”


He’s talking there specifically about the danger of letting your product roadmap be formed from feature requests. He expands on that by pointing out that the product manager should be focusing on the holistic view - i.e. the vision/strategy/context of the product - and that putting the detail of specific features on the roadmap distracts from that, given that the proposed feature may not actually be the best way to meet the goal of the user.

The other general problem with building product roadmaps from features is that until you’ve built the feature, you don’t know how long it’s going to take. And there’s a strong expectation on product roadmaps - from sales, from support, from customers - that the roadmap will give some indication of schedule.

Cagan doesn’t write off product roadmaps. In fact, he comments that they’re one of his favourite tools, as long as they are used to explicitly describe the path from where you are now to how you’re going to reach the vision of the product strategy. They should be simple, high-level, and based around objectives, not features (the folks at ProdPad use similar principles, with [a roadmap built around goals and projects rather than specific features, and with strategic initiatives/themes colouring each item on the roadmap](https://www.prodpad.com/2014/08/roadmapping-in-action-this-is-how-we-do-it/)).

## The Opportunity Backlog

So the product roadmap should simply and clearly define how we’ll achieve our product vision over time at a high level. But how does the actual work get managed, defined, and prioritised? Typically there’ll be a low level queue of work to be done, usually called something like the product backlog (which should be a prioritised set of user stories or similar). And usually the product backlog is created from the product roadmap. But there’s a problem here, as Cagan says:


>   “Most people assume that when something goes on the product roadmap, that the team has every intention of building and launching this. The problem is that if the product discovery team is … validating the ideas with real customers and users as well as stakeholders, then they’ll typically find that at least half of what is on the roadmap is simply not worth doing (usually because the customer doesn’t value it as much as we had hoped, but there are several other reasons that we may decide this is not worth building).”


He suggests [repositioning the product roadmap as an opportunity backlog](http://www.svpg.com/the-opportunity-backlog/), allowing opportunities for the product to be individually assessed to understand the problem that we’re trying to solve, who we’re trying to solve the problem for, and how we’ll know if we’ve succeeded. Repositioning in this way also creates an advantage over a classic product roadmap in that we’re no longer listing specific proposed solutions. This means that if our attempt at solving the problem (our feature or proposed solution) doesn’t work, we can come at it from another direction - we’re trying to make sure we solve the problem - whereas if we’ve put specific features on the roadmap, then we have to deliver those specific features (because our customers and other stakeholders expect them and have planned for them), even if they don’t actually solve the problem or improve the product.

So, your product roadmap should not be based around features, it should be focused on identifying and prioritising the problems that you’re trying to solve.
