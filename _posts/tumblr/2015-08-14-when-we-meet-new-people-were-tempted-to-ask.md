[How Your Job Shapes Your Identity](http://www.thebookoflife.org/how-your-job-shapes-your-identity/), at [The Book Of Life](http://www.thebookoflife.org/category/work/):

> "When we meet new people, we’re tempted to ask: ‘what do you do?’ We’re picking up on the idea that our identity is very linked to our daily tasks… So a dental hygienist will explain how they keep plaque at bay… 
> 
> However, what’s more revealing, but more elusive, are the psychological requirements and consequences of jobs… If we asked: ‘what’s the psychological character of your work?’ the answers would look very different. 
> 
> The dental hygienist might say: I deal a lot with evasion and weakness of the will; otherwise intelligent, trustworthy people cancel on me all the time, blaming their schedules. When they do show up, they sit in my chair and repeatedly lie to me about how much they’ve flossed and break all their promises they made last time about looking after their teeth. I’m daily brought up against how hard adults find it to do pretty basic things that are in their own interests. It can make me a bit stern."
 
Whilst the general thrust of this essay is around the subject of how the work we do defines and alters who we are and how we behave, at a psychological level, I found some of the discussion and ideas interesting from a product management and requirements analysis point of view.

At one level, in trying to design effective products, we need to understand not just what people are trying to do, but why - what are their reasons and motivations for doing the work? What are the skills, capabilities, and constraints that are going to affect them in doing the work? This differentiation is sometimes described in requirements analysis as functional goals and non-functional goals. Satisfying a user’s non-functional goals is a critical aspect of the success of a product, often overlooked.

The essay also provides an interesting technique - seeking to categorise jobs according to psychological profiles, it suggests that jobs can be analysed against spectrums of various traits:

* Patience (aeronautical engineer) vs impatience (news editor)
* Suspicious (antiques dealer) vs trusting (air traffic control)
* Speculative (think tank researcher) vs concrete (fresh fruit logistics)
* Consensus-seeking (school teacher) vs independent (tennis coach)
* Optimistic (sommelier) vs pessimistic (accountant)
* Financially focused (corporate executive) vs sheltered from finance (academic)
* Dignity is fragile (poet) vs a solid status (vet)
* Better nature (midwife) vs worse nature (police officer)
* Logical hierarchy (airline pilot) vs haphazard hierarchy (politics)
* Declining industry (publishing) vs growing industry (social media)

It’s so important to understand _who_ your users and customers are. A product solving the same problem for each of those jobs (say, knowledge management) should be designed totally differently for each context.
