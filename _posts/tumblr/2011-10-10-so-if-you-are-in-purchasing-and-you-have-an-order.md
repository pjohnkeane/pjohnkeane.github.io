So if you are in purchasing and you have an order entry system that relies on the user to enter orders through keyboard input, that will not work on the tablet efficiently.—Peter Eckert, writing at UX Magazine on the need to understand which types of application will work when translated to tablet/touch environments, when designing for the enterprise.This is a theme that came up during my user research. There’s been a lot said about whether or not it’s true that iPads are for consumption not creation, but in the enterprise software world it’s clear that many tasks, and specifically those of voluminous data entry, are poorly suited to touch screen interfaces, whereas keyboard interfaces have been designed specifically for those tasks.However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that the story ends there. Instead, we ought to take a wider view of the systems. Why require high levels of repetitive data entry at all? Are there ways that we can reduce and remove that? For example, consider automation of bookkeeping work: if data feeds can be imported from banking systems and processed automatically as bookkeeping entries, then manual bookkeeping (i.e. data entry) can be eliminated.
