The “Show and Tell” game (Innovation Games, Gamestorming) seems like an excellent way to help everyone learn a bit about each customer participating in the workshop, and also provides an easy way for everyone to contribute with something they know and understand. Further, if different customers from different backgrounds present different artefacts from the same system, and explain why they’re important, this helps each person present to understand the wider scope and possibilities of the system and its context.
