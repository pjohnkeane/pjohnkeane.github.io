A classic essay from the Harvard Business Review, [Reengineering Work: Don't Automate, Obliterate](https://hbr.org/1990/07/reengineering-work-dont-automate-obliterate):

> Many of our job designs, work flows, control mechanisms, and organizational structures came of age in a different competitive environment and before the advent of the computer. They are geared toward efficiency and control. Yet the watchwords of the new decade are innovation and speed, service and quality.

So true.

But this is from **1990**. That **new** decade is the 90s. 

Things change slowly, even in tech.
