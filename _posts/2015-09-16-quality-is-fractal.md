A while back I was listening to the [Product People](http://productpeople.tv) podcast, an interview with Des Traynor of [Intercom](http://blog.intercom.io/author/des/). The whole interview is full of great tidbits about product management (e.g. "I think not talking to your customers was always a pretty pathological thing to do"), but one idea jumped out and stuck: ["quality is fractal"](https://overcast.fm/+JlGbqA0M/14:10). The principle here is that if you look at any one piece or aspect of a product or organisation, that piece or aspect is representative of the whole thing. So you can make an intuitive judgement of the quality of a product based on your knowledge of the background and passion of the CEO, or the quality of a podcast based on the attention to detail given to the intro music or adverts. 

I really love this holistic perspective to thinking about product. Compare with Peter Merholz's idea that [there is no such thing as UX Design](http://www.peterme.com/2014/12/01/there-is-no-such-thing-as-ux-design/) ("user experience is an emergent property of an entire organisation, not just one group") and Seth Godin on how [everything is marketing](http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/print-edition/2013/09/20/marketing-is-everything-says-seth-godin.html) (a derivation from David Packard's "marketing is too important to be left to the marketing department").
