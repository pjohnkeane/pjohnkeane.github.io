I've been reading Marc Andreessen's [The Pmarca Blog Archives](http://a16z.com/2015/01/09/pmarca-blog-ebook/) using [Read](http://www.read.cx). Read makes it really easy to save highlights &mdash; it saves them automatically to Evernote and also sends you a weekly summary by email, so I'm going to do a couple of posts collating a few of the highlights I made. Loads of his articles are specifically about launching startups and getting VC funding (Marc Andreessen is a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, one of the preeminent tech VC firms). I'm not so interested in that stuff. But he also has plenty of interesting and useful thoughts on product management, technology, and business in general. 

Let's start with a couple of quotes about the differences between how work gets done in startups and how it gets done in established companies.

> "In a startup, absolutely nothing happens unless you make it happen."
 
Whereas: 

> "In an established company — no matter how poorly run or demoralized — things happen. They just happen."

I think it's necessary to qualify that: in an established company, things that _usually_ happen, happen. There are some lessons here from startups from those of us established companies. If we're trying to do something **new** (e.g. change a workflow or implement a new tool), then it's not going to happen unless you make it happen. You're fighting against the inertia of the established company.
