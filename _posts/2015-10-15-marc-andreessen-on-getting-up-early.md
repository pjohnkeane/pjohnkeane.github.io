A refreshing view from Marc Andreessen to add to the currently trendy canon of quotes and articles on [getting up early](http://biscuitsforcheese.co.uk/post/92726872766/lets-wake-up-at-430amno-330amno-wait):

> "I'm not going to talk a lot about getting up early or going to bed late or anything else related to the course of a typical day, because everyone's different."

Mind you, strong positions weakly held:
 
> "Personally I think itâ€™s worth whatever effort is involved to go to bed early enough to wake up early enough to have a good solid 45 minutes or an hour for breakfast each morning, if you can pull it off."

I emphatically agree with this. Since becoming a dad, spending quality time in the morning has become so much more important (and it's also become so much easier to get up a bit earlier for some reason, allowing me to take the time to have a proper breakfast).
