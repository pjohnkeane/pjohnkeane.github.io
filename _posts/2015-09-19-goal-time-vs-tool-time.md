> **Jared:** Yeah, so one of the things we’ve been doing with clients is when we take these video tapes and we actually start dividing up the tape into pieces, and any place where the trainer is in essence helping the customer get value – so, in other words, that particular thing, like the customer setting up their first account or their first class or putting in their first instructor, right? They’re getting value from that, and so we call that "goal time".

Whatever you do, don't change it, but then went on to explain why it was there and why it might not be one for people who weren't you, but you should always have it as one.

> **Hagan:** Yeah, don’t touch it.

> **Jared:** Exactly. And so we call that "tool time", right? So that’s the time that you have to just sort of deal with the tool. And you can actually measure how good your UI is doing by the ratio of tool time to goal time, right?

I've spent time training on enterprise software and have encountered exactly this time and again. I think this tactic of identifying goal time and tool time is not just useful for measuring and improving the UI, but is great for designing and implementing training strategies. Training plans should be focused on goals (could also call them outcomes), with time spent learning the tool used to support that - as side notes or foot notes in documentation, for example.

Relating this back to product management, you can also think about tools as features, and goals as [tasks](http://biscuitsforcheese.co.uk/post/127715286216/focus-on-customers-and-tasks-not-features) or [opportunities](http://biscuitsforcheese.co.uk/post/126907408176/feature-requests-product-roadmaps-opportunity-backlog) ... and you should be focusing your roadmap on those tasks and opportunities -- what your users need to actually do, or what problems you're solving for them, not how to do that.
